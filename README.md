## Backlog Ordering

We have ordered the backlog items so that the first ones are infrastructure tasks that will need to be in place before development can begin (setting up boilerplate code, a server, etc.).

Next, we've scheduled the items that will give us a very minimal first iteration of the app. Then, we've ordered the various features we'd like to add, in rough order of importance/value.

## Team Definition of Ready

*Before work can be started on a ticket, it must:*
### 1. Have a title
### 2. Have a user story opening sentence
### 3. Have all business requirements clearly defined
### 4. Have clearly defined acceptance criteria
### 5. Have a story point estimate

## Product Backlog
### Jira Product Backlog <br/>
We stored our product backlog in Jira. The Professor and TA have been given access. [JIRA-URL](https://vuca-nators.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/FT/boards/1/backlog)

### Estimating the Backlog <br/>
The developers all contributed to a one at a time estimating activity points using Polly. A multi-question app in Slack that uses comments and questions to engage in discussions over each user story. We used the Fibonacci Scale for estimating our user story points. The Fibonacci sequence is exponential instead of linear so it helped us to identify the different complexities of each story.

## Project Part 4: SPRINT 3 (Final Sprint)

### Sprint Planning
Planning was held Wednesday, December 1st at 8PM.

**Sprint Goal:** To create a simple, functional front end for Fortune Teller, with more user interaction, that is presentable.

Value this sprint will bring:
For this sprint we plan to bring value by accomplishing as many of the following user stories as we can.
FT-4, As a crypto investor, I want to be able to see the percent change of a cryptocurrency so I can understand it’s performance. https://vuca-nators.atlassian.net/browse/FT-4
FT-30, As a crypto investor, I want to see a screen designed similarly to coinmarketcap.com. https://vuca-nators.atlassian.net/browse/FT-30
FT-7, As a crypto investor, I want to be able to add and remove cryptocurrencies to my watchlist so that I can quickly view them upon login.https://vuca-nators.atlassian.net/browse/FT-7
FT-6, As a crypto investor, I want to be able to view and click on my watchlist tab so that I can see my favorite cryptocurrencies.https://vuca-nators.atlassian.net/browse/FT-6
FT-8, As a crypto investor, I want to be able to sort and filter cryptocurrencies in the list so that I can view the top performing ones. https://vuca-nators.atlassian.net/browse/FT-8
FT-5, As a crypto investor, I want to be able to view the current price and the predicted price so that I can make informed investment decisions. https://vuca-nators.atlassian.net/browse/FT-5

### Forecast

In this sprint we forcasted 14 story points. The rationale for this forecast was that we had completed almost all of our user stories from the previous sprint so we only added 1 more story point to stay within a similar range which based on last sprint worked well for our team. 

We pulled stories into our sprint 3 backlog and only developers participated in this activity. (Based on our scrum team roles becuase our team has everyone in the role of a developer this included the whole team).

Our sprint backlog where the aggregate size of the stories does not exceed our forecast(the size of each backlog item is less than half the forecast velocity for this sprint): https://vuca-nators.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/FT/boards/1/backlog

### What did you do since our last meeting?

<ul>
<li> 
Raul: 
</li>
<li>
Rachel: I worked on FT-47 to add watchlist functionality of adding a watchlist item to the homepage cryptocurrency table
</li>
<li>
James: No work done between Saturday and Tuesday
</li>
<li>
Gabe: 
</li>
<li>
Folake: Worked on trying to get a scrollbar option or feature on the app for the table 
</li>
</ul>

### What will you do until our next meeting?

<ul>
<li> 
Raul: 
</li>
<li>
Rachel: Until the next meeting, I will work on FT-48 of removing an item from the watchlist page
</li>
<li>
James: I will create a powerpoint for our presentation, and work with Raul on integrating front end and back end for final presentation 
</li>
<li>
Gabe: 
</li>
<li>
Folake: I will try to figure out how to recreate the html to allow for the scrolling feature
</li>
</ul>

### Are there any impediments? What is the impediment removal plan?

<ul>
<li> 
Raul:  
</li>
<li>
Rachel: There are some impediments with implementing the watchlist functionality with Javascript. I will be looking into how this will integrate with views.py. 
</li>
<li>
James: The scope of the final integration is broad, may exceed the time we have. We discussed a lightweight  default solution, of pre-generating the price prediction image. 
</li>
<li>
Gabe: 
</li>
<li>
Folake: I had an impediment with trying to decipher the html and needed CSS to bring about scrolling. I plan to do some research on how to do this with the least amount of removal of current working code. 
</li>
</ul>

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment 

<ul>
  <li>
    A Continuous Integration system running: The full CI file is here: https://github.com/gabemansur/vuca-nators/actions/runs/1513591623/workflow
  </li>
  <li>
    The CI workflow is triggered everytime code is pushed to either the main/trunk/master branch or for all branches that are not main.
  </li>
  <li>
    The CI system automatically executes tests:https://github.com/gabemansur/vuca-nators/actions/runs/1513591623
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    You have a Continuous Delivery system running: The full CD file is here: https://github.com/gabemansur/vuca-nators/actions/runs/1513591625/workflow
  </li>
   <li>
    When the build is green the CD system deploys code to production: https://github.com/gabemansur/vuca-nators/actions/runs/1513607021
  </li>
  <li>
    The production is not altered: The build will stop and not deploy to production if the tests do not pass: https://github.com/gabemansur/vuca-nators/actions/runs/1513527306. If the build passes the the deploy will continue running. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Evidence that the CI and CD system exists and behaves properly:

### Sprint Retrospective with Improvement Plan for next sprint

We conducted a sprint retrospective on Dec. 12th at 5pm. (Please note we left the sprint open on Jira and did not select "Complete Sprint" for grading purposes.) Evidence of our sprint retrospective team meeting:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64049629/145774085-9d4e4891-912c-44f3-91fa-09f200811381.png)

As a team we identified at least one helpful change to improve our effectiveness together. We collectively agreed upon an action item that would help us improve and we added it to our product backlog.
Our sprint retrospective action item added to the top of the product backlog for sprint 4: "We aim to integrate at least a portion of the back end, so that we have images generated from it, live, showing data analysis. 

### Sprint Review Rehearsal - before in class Sprint Review 

Our sprint review is at most 10 minutes long

We conducted a Sprint Review Rehearsal following the sprint retrospective on Dec. 12.
